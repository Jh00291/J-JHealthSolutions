# Healthcare System Project

## Project Overview
This project is a healthcare management system designed for a clinic. The system allows **nurses** to manage patient information, appointments, lab tests, and visit details, while **administrators** have access to advanced reporting and querying features. The system is built around a **database-driven application** and features user authentication for nurses and administrators.

The project follows a four-week sprint plan, where critical functionalities are prioritized for implementation over four sprints. Each sprint focuses on different aspects of the system, starting with essential features like login and patient management, and ending with administrative reporting and analysis tools.
